Analysis for the manuscript was performed as follows:

Running:

    python 01_load_and_convert_raw_data_from_expt_format.py

reads the raw data from the original plate format as supplied by the original authors, and produces a flat-table
version of the original raw data with minimal changes made (see comments in code). The file produced is:

    01_rawdata_loaded_from_expt_format.csv

Researchers wanting to do their own independent analysis of the raw measurements can start with this, more conveniently
formatted version of the raw data.

Next, the raw measurements are grouped, and curve fitting and model selection are performed as described in the
manuscript. To perform that step, run (run time is approximately 21 minutes or more):

    python 02_Kd_curve_fitting_and_model_selection.py

which uses the '01_rawdata_loaded_from_expt_format.csv' file as input. The output of curve fitting and model selection
is found here:

    02_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data.csv

Finally, the steps of protein functionality analysis and turning multiple replicates into a single reported affinity is
performed in the following code:

    python 03_replicate_and_functionality_analysis.py

which uses the '02_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data.csv' file as input. The output of this code is found in two files:

    03a_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data_with_functionality_evaluated.csv
    03b_grouped_data_including_published.csv

The first file, '03a_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data_with_functionality_evaluated.csv', shows the results at
the replicate level after protein functionality has been evaluated. The second file,
'03b_grouped_data_including_published.csv', contains the final results at the domain-peptide level.
