Analysis for the manuscript was performed as follows:

Running:

    python 01_load_and_convert_raw_data_from_expt_format.py

reads the raw data from the original plate format as supplied by the original authors, and produces a flat-table
version of the original raw data with minimal changes made (see comments in code). The file produced is:

    01_rawdata_loaded_from_expt_format.csv

Researchers wanting to do their own independent analysis of the raw measurements can start with this, more conveniently
formatted version of the raw data.

Next, the raw measurements are grouped, and curve fitting and model selection are performed as described in the
manuscript. To perform that step, run (run time is approximately 21 minutes or more):

    python 02_Kd_curve_fitting_and_model_selection.py

which uses the '01_rawdata_loaded_from_expt_format.csv' file as input. The output of curve fitting and model selection
is found here:

    02_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data.csv

Finally, the steps of protein functionality analysis and turning multiple replicates into a single reported affinity is
performed in the following code:

    python 03_replicate_and_functionality_analysis.py

which uses the '02_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data.csv' file as input. The output of this code is found in two files:

    03a_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data_with_functionality_evaluated.csv
    03b_grouped_data_including_published.csv

The first file, '03a_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data_with_functionality_evaluated.csv', shows the results at
the replicate level after protein functionality has been evaluated. The second file,
'03b_grouped_data_including_published.csv', contains the final results at the domain-peptide level.




-------------------------

The file '01_rawdata_loaded_from_expt_format.csv', is a conversion of the plate-style raw data format from the original raw data to a flat-table style format, with no additional analysis. Each row in the data represents a single well on the original plate. The data file contains the following columns:

	filename: The filename from the original publication raw data for this row 
	plate_number: The 384-well plate identification number from the original publication raw data
	peptide_number: the id number of the peptide from the original publication master peptide list (found at
		'/origdata/Jones FP master peptide list edited.csv')
	peptide_description: A text description of the peptide from the original publication raw data.
	domain_name: the name of the protein domain tested against the peptide on the plate
	domain_pos: the position on the plate of the domain (relevant in the cases where the same domain was tested more than
		once on the plate)
	domain_conc: the concentration of the domain in the specific well
	FP: the FP value
	bg: a background value common to the entire plate

	Note: There are 12 concentration measurements per domain peptide pair.
	In order to identify the unique domain-peptide pair tested, the filename,
	the plate_number, and the peptide number, plus the the domain and the domain
	position are needed to provide a unique identifier for an experimental interaction.

The file '02_fitted_Kd_and_model_selection_data.csv', contains the 12 measurements for each measurement compressed into one row. Each row then reprsents one full affinity measurement, with the 12 concentrations and 12 FP values. In addition, each row contains results from all models fitted, plus the model selected. The data file contains the following columns:

	domain: protein domain
	gene_name: peptide gene source
	pY_pos: phosphotyrosine position in the original source of the peptide (which, when combined with the gene name, results
		in the common phosphopeptide descriptor, eg. EFGR pY 1172)
	peptide_number: the id number of the peptide from the original publication master peptide list (found at
		'/origdata/Jones FP master peptide list edited.csv')
	peptide_description: A text description of the peptide from the original publication raw data.

	filename: The filename from the original publication raw data for this row
